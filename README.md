I'm an <strong>Experienced Unity Developer</strong> with over 7+ years of expertise in writing clean code and building innovative game prototypes. My focus is on developing unique game controllers and templates, having worked across various game genres, from Hyper-Casual to FPS/TPS. My background in 3D modeling (primarily Blender) gives me an edge in understanding optimizations and how things work in a 3D space.

Alongside my development work, my <strong>IT degree</strong> has strengthened my knowledge of networking and hardware-level operations, allowing me to solve technical challenges with ease. I bring a combination of creativity and technical know-how to every project, always ready to dive into problem-solving and building better solutions.

<h2 align="center">My Journey</h2>

<details>
<summary>Click to read about my journey</summary>
<br>
When I was 5, I fell in love with video games. Those early days were full of wonder as I spent hours immersed in play, all the while dreaming of making games myself one day. At the time, I didn't know how game development worked, but the passion to create never left me.

At 12, I began my coding journey, initially creating malware and viruses just for fun, driven by a fascination with how things work. It wasn't long before I found my true calling‚Äîgame development. I started with GameMaker, which served as my introduction to game creation. But when I discovered Unity 4, everything changed. Unity became my platform, and from then on, I've been coding and building in Unity.

As my skills grew, so did my understanding of various engines. I explored <strong>Unreal, Solar2D (Corona), and Godot</strong>, while mastering languages like <strong>C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript</strong>. Each project was a new chapter, each failure a lesson learned. Today, I continue to build, dream, and code, always looking to push the limits of what's possible in game development.
