<summary>My Journey</summary>

When I was 5, I fell in love with video games. Those early days were full of wonder as I spent hours immersed in play, all the while dreaming of making games myself one day. At the time, I didnâ€™t know how game development worked, but the passion to create never left me.

At 12, I began my coding journey, initially creating malware and viruses just for fun, driven by a fascination with how things work. It wasnâ€™t long before I found my true callingâ€”game development. I started with GameMaker, which served as my introduction to game creation. But when I discovered Unity 4, everything changed. Unity became my platform, and from then on, Iâ€™ve been coding and building in Unity.

As my skills grew, so did my understanding of various engines. I explored **Unreal, Solar2D (Corona), and Godot**, while mastering languages like **C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript**. Each project was a new chapter, each failure a lesson learned. Today, I continue to build, dream, and code, always looking to push the limits of whatâ€™s possible in game development.
